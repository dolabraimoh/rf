help="usage: git-generate

git-generate regenerates a commit from a script kept in the commit message.

Specifically, the topmost commit in the current git repo should have a script
preceded by [git-generate] on a line by itself. The script continues until the
end of the message or a Change-Id: line. The script starts execution in the
root of the git repo.

For example, a commit message might say:

	We are moving from Old to New.

	[git-generate]
	cd some/dir
	sed -i '' 's/Old/New/g' *

To regenerate the commit, git-generate resets the working file state to before
the commit and then runs the script. The script runs using 'bash -e', so any
single command failing will abort the generation.
